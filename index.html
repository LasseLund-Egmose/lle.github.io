            <h1 class="fade-first">Hi! I’m Lasse and I have a great passion for technological engineering.</h1>

                <i>
                    From a young age, I discovered a great interest in technology.
                    Instead of simply playing games or browsing the web, I wanted to know how things worked behind the scenes.
                    I built my first website at the age of 13.
                    With this burning curiosity and passion, choosing a career path was a no-brainer for me.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p class="fade-third">
                Currently, I am <b>pursuing a Master's degree (MSc.) in Computer Science and Engineering at DTU - Technical University of Denmark</b> through the Computer Security study line.
                My courses cover a wide range of topics such as data security, system security, network security, cryptography, ethical hacking, and forensics.
                I expect to graduate from my MSc. in summer 2024, and, in combination with my bachelor's degree (BSc.) in Software Technology, I will receive a Master of Science in Engineering degree (cand.polyt).

            </p>
            <p class="fade-fourth">
                DTU's high ambitions and expectations towards students align perfectly with my own.
                I have <b>always aimed high</b> and embraced challenges to expand my skill set.
                Additionally, my <b>proficiency in task organization and deadline management</b> enables me to accomplish the majority of my goals.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-sixth">
                In the recent years, I have found a great interest in the areas of computer- and cybersecurity.
                I gain valuable experience in this field in my current role as a Student Assistant at Rambøll in the Cyber and Information Security department &mdash; especially from a cybersecurity administration and organizational perspective.
            </p>

            <p class="fade-seventh">
                Furthermore, I am proud to have secured a spot on the 2023 Danish Cybersecurity Championship Team's preliminary roster ("Cyberlandsholdets bruttotrup") based on my strong performance in The Danish Cyber Championships (De Danske Cybermesterskaber) where I placed 8th overall in the senior category of the national final.

                I would love to hear from you!
